		Requirement gathering
		Soft design
		Implementation
		Verification
		Maintenance
------------------------

 1. Scrum
	Iterate changes/development
	Plan-->Build-->Test-->Review

	Product Owner(manager) - have the responsibility
	Scrum Master(team leader) - handle day to day operation
	Team (tester, developer)

	Product Backlogs
		Product owner and Scrum master will take care of this

	User Stories

	Sprint Backlog
		Sprint Planning
		Daily Scrum(15 min meeting)
		Sprint timing - 2 weeks
		
		//After 2 weeks
		Sprint review(after ending od User stories)

	Jo bhi code kra h usko check kr skte h in dev environment

Dig of Scrum
